#### Brown Sugar Cinnamon scoring:
 * **Middle**: classic for a reason and reminds me of my favorite cinnamon sugar toast as a kid
 * **50/50**: the beginning of the downward spiral. why would you degrade the SC experience?
 * **Edges**: standard
 * **Dealers Choice**: middle cause I want that cinnamon diabetes shot direct to my tastebuds
 * **Left Over**: boooo boring edges
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: goodbye good diabetes, hello bad dry crumbly tart

#### Cinnamon Roll scoring:
 * **Middle**: nommmm I love cinnamon rolls and this has just the right crunchy frosting zing
 * **50/50**: like I am trying to be a responsible adult and not just pull out the very middle of the roll
 * **Edges**: like peeling off the very outside of a cinnamon roll when you slacked at squishing cinnamon everywhere
 * **Dealers Choice**: Ms PacMan [clearly the better Pac] went chomp chomp chomp
 * **Left Over**: sadness cause there is no more
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: like I was a good child and ate my eggs and bacon first and now get to chow down on my cinnamon roll dessert. cold isn’t as good as right out of the oven but i’m not turning it down dummy.
