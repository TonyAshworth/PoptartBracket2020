#### Chocolate Chip scoring:
 * **Middle**: holy chocolate batman! like, wow how is it so strong? my face is puckering :thumbsdown:
 * **50/50**: still feels like there are actual crunchy chocolate chips in here. I know it’s not true but such is the magic of this tart. :thumbsup:
 * **Edges**: weird cookie vibes. it’s kinda a cookie? as if your vegan friend make cookie dough and let you eat it. :thumbsdown:
 * **Dealers Choice**: I dunno man. more edges? less chocolate in yo face that way
 * **Left Over**: now all I have is middle goo and it’s taking over my mouf :thumbsdown:
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: oh god cold is so much worse. maybe its worse? maybe its better? I dunno. it’s so strong. I want less strong please. :thumbsdown:

#### Cookies n Cream scoring:
 * **Middle**: warm oreo filling all the way. I need some ice cream to make oreos a’la’mode.  :thumbsup:
 * **50/50**: def more chocolate coming to play. gives the impression of licking out the middle of the oreo and then putting it back together for mostly cookie crunch. :thumbsdown:
 * **Edges**: are you not paying attention? this is oreo cookies. :thumbsdown:
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50, no one wants just oreo cookies left over  :thumbsup:
 * **Left Over**: no thank you, i’m done now.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: I forgot about this and left it for 2 hours. still good when cold!  :thumbsup:
