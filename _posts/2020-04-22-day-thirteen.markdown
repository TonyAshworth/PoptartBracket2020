#### Brown Sugar Cinnamon scoring:
 * **Middle**: excellent cinnamon spice vibes for this cold dreary day. need some tea to go with.
 * **50/50**: adding in edges downplays the spicey flavor which bring me tart sadness
 * **Edges**: begone boring edges
 * **Dealers Choice**: middle goo all the way. just give me BCS at it’s core.
 * **Left Over**: sad stupid edges
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: the sugar starts to take over the cinnamon as it gets cold, also becomes crazy chewy

#### Wildberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: berry delicious pie this morning. nommmmmm berry pies are amazing.
 * **50/50**: more pie crust flavoring to add to berry goodness
 * **Edges**: but plain edges still be boring
 * **Dealers Choice**: gonna split it 50/50 to get full pie feelings.
 * **Left Over**: nada, cause I made smart mouth decisions. go me.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: does lose some of the berry yumminess as it gets colder.
