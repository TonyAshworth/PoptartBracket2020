### Winner: Cinnamon Roll!
*this is getting hardddddd*

#### Cookies n Cream scoring:
 * excellent oreo approximation tart happening here. Eventually as it goes cold, there is too much cookie and not enough cream filling. We really just need to strip off the top layer of the tart and have an openfaced oreo tart sammich.

#### Cinnamon Roll scoring:
 * warm and gooey cinnamon rolls are so nomnomnom. Even as they go cold they are still delicious though warm is always better and that crunchy icing is :chef-kissing-fingertips:

#### Decision:
 * Ultimately it boiled down to this question: can I consume 4 of these in a row? The chocolate cookie is just too much for that  and I legit will never turn down more cinnamon rolls.

 (Editor's note: yes I acknowledge that the format of the comparison has suddenly changed... no I can't say why, the judges have repeated said things like "you're not my mouth", so I assume I am also not their fingers they used to type out their scoring notes.)
