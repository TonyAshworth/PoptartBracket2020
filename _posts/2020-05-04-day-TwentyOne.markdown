#### Wildberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: still trying to figure out the berry flavors… raspberry? blueberry? strawberry? berry pies are the best pies. nommmmm in my mouf 👍
 * **50/50**: more pie crust to go with my excellent pie filling 👍
 * **Edges**: I guess it’s boring but today is full of sunshine and rainbows so IT’S STILL GOOD 👍
 * **Dealers Choice**: chomp chomp chomp pie chomp 👍
 * **Left Over**: shockingly nada, ate it allllll up 👍
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: sugar pie and berry frosting. like a transformer tart! :blobshrug:

#### Cherry scoring:
 * **Middle**: hola cherry, it has been 11 days since you were in my bracket. why, oh why, did you forsake me?! shhhhh we’re not talking about weekend fun times here…. 👍
 * **50/50**: dance the magic cherry pie dance! just the right tart vs sweet combo.  👍
 * **Edges**: I said it was sunshine and rainbows today! why are you not paying attention?! 👍
 * **Dealers Choice**: huge giant bites that made me sad when it was gone.  👍
 * **Left Over**: I’m sorry, are you new here? 👍
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: low key cherry vibes when cold which is kinda sad but not sad enough!  👍
