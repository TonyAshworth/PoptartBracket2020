#### Wildberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: the great berry mystery continues as I still don’t know what combo of berries exist! though fruity pie nom
 * **50/50**: more crust = more pie vibes, though this is sad grandmother crust
 * **Edges**: sad pie should not be sad
 * **Dealers Choice**: give me the goo, Berry Goo
 * **Left Over**: why you gotta bring edges to my goo party?
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: like when you let a 5 yr old “sprinkle” sugar on the berries and instead the dump a sugar waterfall

#### Cinnamon Roll scoring:
 * **Middle**: ahhhhh yisssss, cinnamon rolls come to mama. how I have missed you.
 * **50/50**: more dough so I’m now being a responsible adult in my food choices
 * **Edges**: all dough and no cinnamon or frosting makes me sad
 * **Dealers Choice**: chomp chomp chomp. I ate. I cheered. I got sad it was gone.
 * **Left Over**: zero. cause I ate it.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: chewier than before but flavor stays thebomb.com
