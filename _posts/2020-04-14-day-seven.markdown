### Winner: Cookies & Creme!
#### *[oreos trump apple pie as apple pie is my least favorite pie and I lived on oreos while in asia]*

#### Cookies & Cream scoring:
 * **Middle**: zomg itâ€™s a warm oreo, toasting may have been a bad idea. fun fact: breaking it apart makes the middle goo get all marshmallow stringy.
 * **50/50**: with edges then it gets more cookie flavor and balances out the middle goo
 * **Edges**: zomg edges taste EXACTLY like oreo cookie pieces. like my brain is so confused/excited right now
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50 split. man this is exactly like an oreo. ITS SO WEIRD
 * **Left Over**: im getting better at this
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: IT IS AN OREO WHEN COLD

##### Apple Cinnamon Sugar scoring:
 * **Middle**: apple pie with spices. whoa apple pie vibes
 * **50/50**: oooo the pastry part is nice. its has a spice feeling thats lovely and goes with the pie.
 * **Edges**: this frosting is so yum!
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50 pie time
 * **Left Over**: no edges left for meeeeee
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: they kinda start getting greasy? the plate has grease spots which is freaking me out
