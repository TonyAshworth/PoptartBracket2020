#### Strawberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: strong strawberry flavor out of the gate which is a bit sweet but still yummy pie. Berry pies are the best! except for key lime, I want key limeeeeee poptarts! actually that would prob be very sad, nevermind.
 * **50/50**: more pie like flavor which helps tone down the oversweetness
 * **Edges**: boringgggg
 * **Dealers Choice**: as close to pie as possible
 * **Left Over**: edges
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: as it gets cold the strawberry becomes a diabetes sugar bomb. way way too sweet.

#### Chocolate Pretzel scoring:
 * **Middle**: excellent combo of dark chocolate and salty goodness. Not too much, not too little. Juuuuuuuust right.
 * **50/50**: more salt more better
 * **Edges**: no edges here! just a tad more pretzel vibe
 * **Dealers Choice**: chomp it up
 * **Left Over**: until you canâ€™t eat it
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: becomes very chewy as it gets cold and the pretzel starts to weirdly flake everywhere.
