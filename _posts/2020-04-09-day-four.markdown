### Winner: Cherry!
**(Though blueberry put up a good fight)*

![round 1 - 7 vs 9]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/round-1--7-vs-9.jpg)

#### Blueberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: whoa man, smurf city. had no idea so much blueberry could be had in â€™tarts
 * **50/50**: nice combo actually, a little more blueberry pie feels
 * **Edges**: standard
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50, tone down the blueberry a bit and get a full pie feel
 * **Left Over**: nada, went 50/50 all the way to the end
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: blueberry flavor does diminish when cold and that kinda helps the intensity

##### Cherry scoring:
 * **Middle**: oh cherry, here is joy and rapture
 * **50/50**: cherry pie time
 * **Edges**: standard
 * **Dealers Choice**: bring on the cherry goo please! slightly tart and not too sweet
 * **Left Over**: sad edges with no cherry zing
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: is there anything cherry cant handle? tastes great in both, though hot is the best
