### Winner: Strawberry!
*I made a mistake but it was a new terrible tart. Progress!*

Editor's note: The judges didn't want to eat apple cinnamon sugar so a random challenger tart flavor was introduced. Much disappointment was had but let's be honest Apple Cinnamon Sugar wasn't going to win and neither would have Fruit Loops. Back to your regularly scheduled poptart content.

#### Strawberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: sweet strawberries covered in sugar are back
 * **50/50**: more pie vibes now, with a nice boring crust from my grandma who could not bake.
 * **Edges**: aka boring crust
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50 I like the pie please
 * **Left Over**: crusty pieces left which is ok cause I will now go eat some cheese and crackers as an apology to my mouth
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: sweet sweet strawberry cement goo.

#### Fruit Loops scoring:
 * **Middle**: oh holy poo on toast this is a fruit loop. but a sour fruit loop? my face is not doing good things as I eat it.
 * **50/50**: its like my mouth tasted the edges and felt relief but itâ€™s a !pysch! cause BAM here comes the sour loops just when you thought it was safe.
 * **Edges**: :pray: you and your safe boring haven
 * **Dealers Choice**: ummmm do I have to?
 * **Left Over**: I decided I am an adult doing a poptart bracket and I get to make the rules. ergo I refuse to consume more. except one more bite to confirm it is terrible. bite BAM SOUR. confirmed terrible.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: ok starts out better, less sweet so I feel safe but here it comessssssssss BAM SOUR. I do not remember fruit loops being sour and you are RUINING my childhood. how can poptarts ruin childhood?! they are childhood!
