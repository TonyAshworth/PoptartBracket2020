ðŸŽ‰ I present to you, The Heather Pop-Tart April Madness Bracket ðŸŽ‰

Perhaps one of the most thrilling sporting events of the year, in which I will consume 60 pop-tarts over the next 30 days. The one and only Jan Koszewski has created a true double elimination bracket for me.

We welcome all kind of participation including (but not limited to): filling out your own bracket based on your tastes, filling out a bracket to guess what terrible decisions I will make, heckling the judge, bribing the judge (really encouraged) and having one heck of a good time.

Each day I will complete one pairing of pop-tarts which will be toasted (because Iâ€™m not a heathen) and judged on the following criteria:
 * pure middle goo yumminess
 * 50% middle goo / 50% edges
 * edges only
 * dealerâ€™s choice
 * whateverâ€™s left
 * finally: better hot or cold?

This is a highly scientific excercise and I reserve the right to change any grading criteria at any time.
