### Winner: Pretzel Chocolate!

![day 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rounds/day-6.jpg)

#### Strawberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: frankly better than I remember and is way less sweet than the blueberry flavors.
 * **50/50**: nice balance between the sweet and the doughy edges
 * **Edges**: standard
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50 so im not left with edges only at the end
 * **Left Over**: nada, I am capable of planning tart consumption. go me.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold isnt the best. goo becomes thicker and the strawberry sweetness gets a bit intense.

#### Pretzel Chocolate scoring:
 * **Middle**: weirdly starts out with almost no flavor and then intense chocolate kicks in
 * **50/50**: still cannot really taste the pretzel. like itâ€™s there if I concentrate?
 * **Edges**: no edge weirdness is back!! but the more I eat it the more the pretzel flavor comes out.
 * **Dealers Choice**: tried to nibble the edges just for fun. felt like a squirrel.
 * **Left Over**: 50/50 is nomnomnom
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold is actually great! the saltiness kicks in more, the chocolate is toned down. its like chocolate dipped preztels and I like it.
