#### Pretzel Chocolate scoring:
 * **Middle**: slight chocolate flavor with little bit salt
 * **50/50**: again with the no edges! so bizarre but it does also get saltier, yum salt
 * **Edges**: squirrel heather is BACK
 * **Dealers Choice**: I dont know? I just kept eating it and forgot to write it down. I assume middle cause I had edges left.
 * **Left Over**: edges all over the place
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold pretzel is no good. was warm and now cold does not do good things to pretzels.

#### S'mores scoring:
 * **Middle**: holy poo, so much marshmallow flavor (hey look at my spelling! go me!)
 * **50/50**: now its all chocolate and graham cracker crust. a whole new tart is happening.
 * **Edges**: oooo slightly burnt graham cracker
 * **Dealers Choice**: avoiding the edges, cause the graham cracker burnedness is weirding me out
 * **Left Over**: so many edges! why is this my life now.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: omg its now an actual marshmallow, like legit transformed. how does it continue to change?!
