![day 18]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rounds/day-18.jpg)

#### Blueberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: INTENSE BLUEBERRY which tastes like a jolly rancher 👎
 * **50/50**: edges help tone down the jolly rancher vibes and turns into a pie instead :blobshrug:
 * **Edges**: standard 👍
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50 more edges and therefore more blueberry pie :blobshrug:
 * **Left Over**: edges everywhere 👎
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: zomg it is so sweet when it gets cold. sugar city and very dry. pass me a beverage please. 👎

#### Cinnamon Roll scoring:
 * **Middle**: mmmmmm cinnamon rolls. I miss brunch!👍
 * **50/50**: hard to describe but the tart has a different texture to it which is more like dough, so it def feels like a cinnamon roll. plus the icing is drizzled and actually tastes like drizzled icing, yum. 👍
 * **Edges**: dough and icing, which reminds me of picking off the stuck bits on a baking pan :blobshrug:
 * **Dealers Choice**: middle first and then edges 👍
 * **Left Over**: none! :blobshrug:
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold becomes chewier and weirdly stickier. but flavor is still good rollie times.  👎
