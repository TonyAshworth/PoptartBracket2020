#### Chocolate Fudge scoring:
 * **Middle**: HOT. too hot! did not wait for it to cool down. molten chocolate lava in my mowfs
 * **50/50**: gooey crunch begins. good? bad? I dunno.
 * **Edges**: sad chocolate cookie bits. again with the faux chocolate flavor! stop it!
 * **Dealers Choice**: middle I guess? dont contaminate with sad cookie
 * **Left Over**: well fork me, now all I have is sad cookie
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold chocolate molasses is so sticky. SO STICKY. why is this the goal?!

##### Pretzel Cinnamon Sugar scoring:
 * **Middle**: yummmm low key cinnamon flavor, though it did not want to break into two pieces and just folded in halfâ€¦. pretzels be weird.
 * **50/50**: again with the no edges but flaky fun begins
 * **Edges**: tried so hard to just eat the edge. Squirrel Heather is back.
 * **Dealers Choice**: its all the same! so I ates it.
 * **Left Over**: crumbs? salt crystals on the plate?
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: it starts to fall apart as it gets cold and now my yoga pants are covered in tart flakes
