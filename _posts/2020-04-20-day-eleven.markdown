#### Sugar Cookie Fudge Brownie Duo scoring:
 * **Middle**: oh gack. want to feel your teeth rotting in your skull? or your tastebuds crying out in horror? have I got the pop-tart for you
 * **50/50**: sugar cookie is vanilla overload and sad blue frosting. it tastes blue. and no do not ask me what blue tastes like. brownie is slightly better because it at least tastes like something that exists in the real world and not just a color.
 * **Edges**: there is one side of this poptart that has no frosting and I ate it all. a Switzerland in this madness of poo river tarts.
 * **Dealers Choice**: no. just please no. FINE brownie.
 * **Left Over**: vanilla death spiral.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: the fact that you have managed to make me hate both sugar cookies and brownies is astonishing as I love these two desserts. and yet, you have accomplished this fact. GOOD FOR YOU KELLOGG’S. GOOD. FOR. YOU.

##### Strawberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: ok normally I think strawberry is too sweet but compared to the Poo River monstrosity this is your grandmother’s sugar free candy.
 * **50/50**: much more edge flavor here to drown the sweet strawberry flavor
 * **Edges**: standard. boring. life saving.
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50 /50 like a tart is forking supposed to work.
 * **Left Over**: nada. I ate it. I didn’t internally cry or externally scream WTF WOULD YOU MAKE THIS?! ergo delicious.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: thank you for being born strawberry. please go tell all your other berry friends that I miss them at any temperature.

 ##### Judges Mouth Thoughts
 * this tart was made by drunken keebler elves that also got into some quality cocaine or LSD I fear
 * I keep eating the middle!! WHY
 * determining the winner is easy right now. but put the splitz against the strawberry milkshake and WHO THE HELL KNOWS
 * I weirdly want to have some competition from the terrible gross tarts but also I never want to see them again so
 * oh god, just, no, the smell alone
 * you know when youre a kid and you dont want to eat the thing and then finally you put it in your mouth but you cant make yourself chew and/or swallow it? this is my life now
