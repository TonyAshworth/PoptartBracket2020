#### Wild Berry scoring:
 * **Middle**: very very berry goo but mostly blueberry flavor? maybe? does blueberry just overwhelm everything else?
 * **50/50**: tones down the goo factor which is good
 * **Edges**: standard edges
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50 the combo is needed for yumminess
 * **Left Over**: edges
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: actually is good on both! warm it’s fruity goo or it turns into fruit rollup consistency when cold.

#### Pretzel Cinnamon Sugar scoring:
 * **Middle**: exact same as BCS, very tiny bit of pretzel flavor but dont know I would notice on my own
 * **50/50**: slightly less filling but you can taste more pretzel flavor now
 * **Edges**: has no edges goo goes to the fold! less goo but still goo, it’s weirddddddd
 * **Dealers Choice**: middle goo
 * **Left Over**: edgy less goo bits, also this starts to flake as more time goes on
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: must be hot. the cold just makes it taste like a warm soft pretzel that then dried out sad and alone on a pretzel rack
