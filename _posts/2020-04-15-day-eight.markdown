### Winner: Chocolate Chip!

![day eight]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rounds/day-8.jpg)

#### Chocolate Chip scoring:
 * **Middle**: whoa dude def chocolate chip cookie vibes. feels like it might have chunks of chips in there? prob not and I just imagined it.
 * **50/50**: edges do not improve this situation, it is so much chocolate goo. dont know how but became stronger choco goo in flavor.
 * **Edges**: this is what a sad cookie tastes like. it tries to be a cookie but its like you forgot the butter or something. plus with the Tart Holes™ it looks like a cookie and that makes it worse!
 * **Dealers Choice**: ummmm I guess I go for middle goo only? but thats leaves me with sad edges? FINE 50/50
 * **Left Over**: tears and self-pity
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold becomes more like a chocolate cookie I guess? I need a glass of milk, this goo is sticking in my teeth.

#### Hot Fudge Sundae scoring:
 * **Middle**: what in the holy poo on toast is this flavor?! marshmallow is there… and sugar cookie… and the icing is so think it crunches….
 * **50/50**: ok im getting it now. chocolate pastry with white middle goo is ice cream covered in chocolate. but just because I get it doesnt make it good kelloggs! still just tastes like VANILLA IN YO FACE.
 * **Edges**: please stop making “chocolate” outsides. they do not taste like chocolate. they are a sad chocolate substitute. its like sugar free chocolate and this should never exist.
 * **Dealers Choice**: ugh, middle I guess? less fake chocolate cookie
 * **Left Over**: edges with crunchy icing and lame sprinkles
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: gack cold is not good, I say again NOT GOOD. my teeth are rotting in my skull. I can feel it.

#### Judges Mouth Thoughts
* omg the sugar smell alone as I open the packages
* they should just stop doing swirl frosting. it never looks good, always looks like poo trails.
* whoa chocolate smell overload from the toaster. but is it from today or yesterday?
* no it was def from today. my plate smells like the inside of a chocolate factory
* omg the middle of the hot fudge sundae is white goo. which I guess makes sense but also I thought it would be chocolate? why ?!
* oh god I have to keep eating these
* please dont make me
* where is cherry? CHERRY IM SO SORRY. come back to me!
* I cant tell if I need a good cookie to wash this memory away or if I am banned from cookies for the rest of eternity for this travesty.
* I can still have cookies though right? im nice, this isnt my fault.
* ugh I still have some left! I keep looking away hoping they disappear.
* update they do not magically disappear
* it’s like a raging toddler had a go at the plate, just pieces left that make no sense
