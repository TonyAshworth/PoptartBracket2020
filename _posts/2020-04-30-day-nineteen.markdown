#### S'mores scoring:
 * **Middle**: strong AF marshmallow flavor with hints of graham cracker 👎
 * **50/50**: 50/50 means you now only get chocolate and graham cracker which makes the whole thing taste very differently. :blobshrug:
 * **Edges**: if I squint very hard it tastes like a graham cracker but it’s a sad cracker 👎
 * **Dealers Choice**: trying to make sure I get chocolate and marshmallow and enough crusts to make an actual smore 👍
 * **Left Over**: edges 👎
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: suuuuuuper sweet chocolate and marshmallow combo. it got sweeter so they lie when they says cold is less sweet.  👎

#### Strawberry scoring:
 * **Middle**: sweet AF strawberry flavor, its like you took strawberries and covered them in sugar 👎
 * **50/50**: edges help tone down the sugar explosion 👍
 * **Edges**: standard 👎
 * **Dealers Choice**: not really sure, just kinda chomped into it, so I guess 50/50? :blobshrug:
 * **Left Over**: more edges 👎
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold strawberry should be good because its like that in fruit form but this is not good. cold sugar strawberry mess 👎
