### Winner: Cinnamon Roll!

![round 1 - 5 vs 11]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/round-1--5-vs-11.jpg)

#### Cinnamon Roll scoring:
 * **Middle**: very cinnamony, even more than BCS, though less frosting flavor! I thought I wouldnt like less frosting but it kinda works here.
 * **50/50**: starts off kinda bland but then the cinnamon kicks in as an aftertaste? weird but yummy
 * **Edges**: tastes like nothing, doesnt even get frosting to help
 * **Dealers Choice**: middle goo all the way
 * **Left Over**: 50/50 is nice, like little baby cinnamon bites
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: warm was better but even as cold sludge it was yummy!

##### Strawberry Milkshake scoring:
 * **Middle**: omg tastes pink. does it taste like strawberries? god I hope strawberries do not taste like this. I am being poisoned by pink sugar
 * **50/50**: slightly less pink flavor, still cannot actually tell you what it tastes like!
 * **Edges**: standard and boring and yet found myself wanting to eat only the edge, no middle goo please!
 * **Dealers Choice**: edges please and thank you
 * **Left Over**: im begging you, please dont make me
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: honestly dont know which is better. warm is overwhelmingly pink but cold makes it thicker? im confused and sad.
