#### Cinnamon Roll scoring:

 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50 baby. give me that sweet sweet brunch feeling.
 * **Left Over**: crumbs
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: whoa major cinnamon flavor as it gets colder, start to lose the cinroll vibes

#### ??? scoring:

 * **Edges**: at least 50% of edges still have tasty cherry frosting
 * **Dealers Choice**: I ate. I loved. end of story.
 * **Left Over**: nada
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold does become sweeter and loses some of the tartness in flavor.
