#### Chocolate Chip Cookie scoring:
 * **Middle**: how can it taste like so much chocolate? how is chocolate not good?? 👎
 * **50/50**: cookie vibe begins to kick in but not in a good way 👎
 * **Edges**: please please please stop making sad cookies. cookies should never be sad.  👎
 * **Dealers Choice**: middle. less sad cookie but more sad squish. 👎
 * **Left Over**: giant chunks are still here. 👎
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: how is it so chewy. I have never worked so hard to eat a cookie in my life. 👎

#### Apple Sugar Cinnamon scoring:
 * **Middle**: dagnabit apple pie. why does america love you? can we introduce them to other pies?? 👎
 * **50/50**: adding edges does not help? maybe it helps? I dunno anymore 👎
 * **Edges**: standard? maybe its different? it still tastes like pie which is so wrong. 👎
 * **Dealers Choice**: 50/50, trying to tone down the stupid apple pie   👎
 * **Left Over**: so many chunks left. please make them go away. 👎
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold apple pie begins to taste like those terrible Hostess pies? why doesnt the spice help?! 👎
