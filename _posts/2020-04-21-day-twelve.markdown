#### Hot Fudge Sundae scoring:
 * **Middle**: ah shiz, the vanilla overload is back and it brought their friend crunchy frosting.
 * **50/50**: the crunching frosting is seriously creeping me out today, not sure why. though the flavor is less IN YO FACE when edges are present
 * **Edges**: kinda digging the low key chocolate cookie vibe on the edges. used to bug me but now its a nice break.
 * **Dealers Choice**: tried to keep it 75 edge, 25 middle. less sugar explosion
 * **Left Over**: edges! I weirdly keep eating the middle, I don’t know why. cause I want to determine flavor? I’m eating on a call and not paying attention? who knows why I do what I do.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: ohhhh cold turns into a marshmallow thing. like all thicky sticky marshmallow (sorry HR)

#### ??? scoring:
 * **Middle**: apple pie, which again (don’t @ me), is the worst pie.
 * **50/50**: the edges help tone down the intense sugar rush of the crappy pie flavor
 * **Edges**: standard
 * **Dealers Choice**: let’s go with 50/50. I can imagine less apple flavor this way.
 * **Left Over**: ugh I dunno. I had mostly edges left over once it got cold.
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: cold apple pie blerg. somehow became more spice flavor and also more sugar overload. this is a very confusing tart. also now it has crunchy frosting! I dont like the crunchy frosting.
