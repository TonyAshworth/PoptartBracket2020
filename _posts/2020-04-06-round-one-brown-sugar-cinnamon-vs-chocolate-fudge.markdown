#### Scoring of Chocolate Fudge:
 * **Middle**: tastes exactly like a fudge brownie which was delicious
 * **50/50**: however the sides ended up being like a very dry and overbaked brownie, which ended up ruining the tasty middle
 * **Sides alone**: so gross, so dry, such weird “lite chocolate flavor”
 * **Fav part**: middle, nommm
 * **Left over**: sides, blerg
 * **Hot vs cold**: def needs to be hot. cold ended up slightly congealing and got really weird
 * In general, while tasty, it was overwhelmingly too much chocolate. I’m not sure I could eat 2 full poptarts as I struggled to get through just the 1.
