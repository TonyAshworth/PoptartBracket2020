![day 17]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rounds/day-17.jpg)

#### Pretzel Cinnamon Sugar scoring:
 * **Middle**: slight cinnamon flavor, not overpowering but also not super flavorful 👎
 * **50/50**: starts to pick up more salt which is nice, gives it a bit different vibe 👍
 * **Edges**: squirrel heather and the lack of edges™ coming to a theatre near you :blobshrug:
 * **Dealers Choice**: try to get an edge with each bite to get more salty goodness :blobshrug:
 * **Left Over**: flaky crumbs and salt crystals everywhere 👎
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: pretzels gets crazy chewy when they go cold in not a good way 👎

#### Brown Sugar Cinnamon scoring:
 * **Middle**: excellent cinnamon spice vibes, childhood in tart form 👍
 * **50/50**: edges start to tone down the cinnamon which is kinda ok? I dont need to tone it down though :blobshrug:
 * **Edges**: super boring edges 👎
 * **Dealers Choice**: mostly middle, trying not to leave too many edges behind 👍
 * **Left Over**: well failed at that, def plate full of edges now :blobsob:
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: yummy cold cinnamon sugar vibes. this is what I ate for bfast everyday during high school. 👍
