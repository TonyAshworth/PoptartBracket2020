#### Chocolate Pretzel scoring:
 * **Middle**: slight chocolate paired with slight salt. I dont understand how so many other poptarts are IN YO FACE and this one is so subtle. are they made abroad? are these non loud american tarts? :blobshrug:
 * **50/50**: more slight flavors. come on at least go all in on the chocolate or salt vibe :blobthumbsdown:
 * **Edges**: they have no edges but this tarts filling doesnt go to the edge. so you actually get pretzel only flavor! it’s not a bug, it’s a feature. :blobthumbsup:
 * **Dealers Choice**: I tried to eat the non filling parts just to know if I could get more pretzel but welp you can’t :blobthumbsdown:
 * **Left Over**: chocolate? salt? I am chewing but also my brain is not tasting :blobthumbsdown:
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: how does it have less flavor now? how is that possible? maybe more salt but less chocolate? my mouf is confused :blobthumbsdown:

#### Cookies n Cream scoring:
 * **Middle**: oreo filllinggggggggg. creamy yummy goodness. :blobthumbsup:
 * **50/50**: less cream, more cookie which only reminds me why I take off one oreo cookie and have an openfaced oreo :blobshrug:
 * **Edges**: not actually sad chocolate cookie flavor cause it’s an oreo cookie but also I don’t want just the cookie part :blobthumbsdown:
 * **Dealers Choice**: mostly filling, cause it’s the best part of the oreo :blobthumbsup:
 * **Left Over**: cookies everywhere with no filling which should just be thrown in the trash for being a failure :blobthumbsdown:
 * **Hot Vs Cold**: guess you can’t go from warm oreo to cold oreo without it becoming cement. so there’s that.  :blobthumbsdown:
