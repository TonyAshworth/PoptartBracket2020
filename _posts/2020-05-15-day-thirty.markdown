#### Cherry scoring:
 * oh we love the cherry pie, cherry pie is the best pie with the exception of key lime pie which as previously discussed would not make a good tart. oh how I have missed you cherry pie!

#### Cinnamon Roll scoring:
 * mmmmmm warm gooey cinnamon rolls is there anything better for brunch? that gooey center, that crunchy icing, that high calorie buttery taste?

#### Decision:
 * which could I eat 4 in a row? fake cherry would be too much to handle and so…. omg…. I can’t….. I legit cannot believe this but here we go: I will choose Cinnamon Roll
